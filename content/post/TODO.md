This is my site to publish technology that I find interesting...  personally.
Revolves around Cloud ( mostly AWS), Flutter for Mobile and web, Docker/K8, Blockchain and ESP32.
I have two agendas.
1. I want to build out a publishing site, and actually do some development.
2. A place to document what I am doing.

and some extent, get some add revenue.


You should notice... 
1. a code section that drills down to specific technologies.  
2. A challenge section where I have been collecting / inventing interesting intervie challenges.

The samples section is just assorted things to do with Markdown.
Of cource I include a Blog section...  just my personal rants.
