My name is vincent youmans...  and I experiment with Tech often. Assuming people are interested, I like to document what I am doing:


### Focus
- GoLang - the Language
    - https://go.dev/
    - https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go

- AWS - Amazon Web Services
    - https://aws.amazon.com/

- HUGO - CMS
    -  https://gohugo.io/

- Flutter/DART - Cross platform Mobile, web and Desktop dev
    -  https://flutter.dev/

- Hyperledger Fabric - A private BlockChain
    - https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric
    - I am doing this basically because smart contracts are written in Go ( aka chain code )

- Hyperledger sawtooth
    - https://www.hyperledger.org/use/sawtooth
    - Loosing intrest for now, but its getting buzz
    - golang and RSUT sdk
